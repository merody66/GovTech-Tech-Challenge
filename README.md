Repository containing solutions to Data-Engineer-Tech-Challenge

The repo is structured in 5 different branches according to the challenge requirements <br>
1. data-pipelines
2. databases
3. sys-design
4. charts-apis
5. ml

## Databases Task
For this task, I have created the Entity-Relationship Diagram based on the requirements specified before 
creating the Dockerfile and DDL statements .sql file. <br>
Based on some tutorials I found online, we can start Postgres with Docker Compose. <br>

## Run
Ensure Docker is running in the background, then do `$docker-compose up` to start the Postgres service up.
It will initialize the PostgreSQL db with the initial tables.
